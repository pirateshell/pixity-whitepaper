Pixity is a serious game solution that implements the design methodology of Gamification. It consists of two parts - a board game and digital quests. The users (in this case players) play a board game that allows them to build their path through Gothenberg in an interactive way. This path ends up at a final destination, for example a Gothenberg landmark, cafe or event hall. Then the user is urged to continue their quest by actually visiting the location, where they can scan a QR code allowing them to play a digital quest that takes place in that location and allows them to learn more about it, interact socially and generally spend time at the location.

### Primary goals
Pixity has a few primary goals - providing a playful entry point to the ecosystem, creating a path through the city in an engaging and fun way, motivating users to use Accesscity to get to a destination in Gothenberg and helping them learn and interact with the location once they are there.

##### 🕹️ Playful entry point
Everyone is familiar with board games to some degree and most people enjoy them. Thus, Pixity is an inticing entry point for a task that otherwise might seem daunting or that users would not have any intrinsic motivation to perform. In this case, exploring a city and building their path through it.

##### 🗺️ Creating a path through the city
Using the engaging and fun aspects of games we can help users create a path unique to them. They can build their own narratives and end up at places that they may otherwise not have considered. This can all happen in a natural way that doesn't feel arbitrary, while they have fun.

##### 🚌 Motivating users to use Accesscity
By integrating Pixity with Accesscity, once the players have completed building their path through Gothenberg, they can reach their destination by using Accesscity. In this way Pixity can leverage gamification's ability to motivate in a more meta sense, by motivating players to engage with the ecosystem itself.

##### 📱 Digital quests
By doing a digital quest in a certain location, Pixity can serve as a serious game that allows people to learn, explore and engage with the space around them. Maybe there is a quiz that asks them to observe their environment? Maybe there is a reward that they can obtain by getting a coffee? Maybe some other way to engage with their space in a social way? The possibilities are endless and Pixity can serve as a great external motivator for this.

Additionally, if these quests exist inside the Accesscity app itself, it is one more reason to get people to use it, once again allowing Pixity to be motivational in a meta sense.

### Design
As mentioned, Pixity consists of a board game and a digital game. The full design blueprint and details for each can be found in the the [Board game design document](board-gdd.md) and [Digital game design document](digital-gdd.md)

### TODO: Prototype
Include a link to any prototypes. Describe their implementation.

### TODO: User evaluation
TODO: Describe a user evaluation process & its results. Hopefully supports that Pixity is successful in what its trying to achieve.
