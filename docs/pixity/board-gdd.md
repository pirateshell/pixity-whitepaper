# Board game design document

Below is a game design document for the board game part of Pixity. Its structure is primarily based on the proposed template by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill written by Diane Pozefsky. You can find it [here](https://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~pozefsky/seriousgames/NewDesignDocTemplate.pdf).

### Game details
- **Name:** Pixity
- **Tagline:** TBD.
- **Team:** 
    - Mila Koeva
    - Pirouz Nourian
    - Filip Ivanov
    - Reyhaneh Ghofranikajani
- **Last updated:** 11/02/2026

### Game overview
This is intended as a cohesive paragraph or two that lets someone understand what you are working on. Include the below elements.

##### 🕹️ Purpose of the game
What is the primary purpose of the game outside of playing it? A serious game requires a serious goal like achieving a pedagogical objective, training goal, or intended social impact. If it is addressing a problem, explain what that problem is (for example, students have a hard time...)

##### 🕹️ Intended use
How does your game help achieve that serious goal? For example, how it is to be inserted into a pedagogical scenario or how will it be used in training, therapy, rehabilitation, etc. You should distinguish between a game that is stand alone, a supplement to another activity, etc.

##### 🕹️ Justification for the use
Is there research that shows that this is apt to be successful? Are there are other games or applications that take a similar approach? If this is an experiment to see if it will work, why does the researcher believe that it might? Essentially, why would we try this solution for the problem?

##### 🕹️ Target audience
 Your target audience must be well defined. There’s a significant difference in a game teaching biology to a kindergartener or to a college student.

##### 🕹️ Genre(s)
The genre (or multiple genres) of your game.

### Gameplay
This section would tell a player what to expect. Not a lot of detail (that comes later).

##### 🕹️ Objectives
What are the objectives of the game? Is it to reach a destination, retrieve the chalice, accrue the most money, or solve a puzzle in the fastest amount of time?

##### 🕹️ Game Progression and Play Flow
How does the game flow for the game player? Is there an overall scoring and objective for the game or is it a progression of levels? Is it endless? Is it based around a single playthrough? What does that playthrough look like?

##### 🕹️ Mission, challenge, puzzle, etc. structure
What are the different "beats" of the game defined? Does the player have a mission? Do they solve puzzles? Do they fight monsters? etc.

### Mechanics

These are topics that should be covered if relevant. All games are different and not everything applies. Consider this a checklist to help you capture all that is important. It should be complete enough that someone could build a clone of your game based on this detail.

##### 🕹️ Rules
Include both implicit and explicit rules that define the interactions with your game.

##### 🕹️ Model of the game universe
Think of it as a simulation of a world, how do all the pieces interact? If it is a puzzle game, there may be no universe to discuss, but there is the layout and the structure of the puzzle. Included in the universe are:
    - **Physics:** How does the physical universe in your game work? If there are no physics, do not try to create them.
    - **Economy:** What is the economy of the game? How does it work? The economy incudes the items that the player is trying to collect as well as a world economy. How does a player earn or lose these items?
    - **Other aspects:** Other relevant aspects to the overall universe of the game.

##### 🕹️ Character actions
The different actions that the character can perform, such as movement, interaction with objects, combat with enemies, dialog choices, etc.

##### 🕹️ Screen Flow
How each screen is related to every other and a description of the purpose of each screen.

### Story and Narratives

If you have a puzzle game, there is probably no backstory or story. As soon as you add an avatar of any sort, you have a story. It may be as simple as who the character is.

##### 🕹️ Backstory
If there is no plot or narrative in the story but you need to understand the background, that is a backstory. The backstory can also be setting the stage for the story that is going to unfold.

##### 🕹️ Plot elements
There are multiple patterns of a plot: the 3-act play, the hero’s journey, episodic, … Use one of the models to describe the story of the game.

##### 🕹️ Game story progression
Explain how the progression of the plot is exposed to the player. Remember that there are different approaches to the narrative: how it is exposed, who is telling it and the sequence that things happen. If you are using cut scenes to progress the story, describe the cut scenes in detail.

### Game World

Describe the general look and feel of world. Of particular importance is whether the world is broken up into different areas that are relevant to the game. If it is, describe how they are connected, how the player moves between them, and how they relate to levels.

### Characters and Opponents

##### 🕹️ Player avatar
Indicate if the user has the ability to define their own avatar and what options they are able to define.

##### 🕹️ Non-playable characters (NPCs)
Identify the characters present, but not playable. Describe their backstory, personality, appearance and abilities. If there are characters that are relevant to the game but never seen, be sure to include them. Include enemies and opponents.

### Levels / Quests
Provide a general description of how levels are used in the game as well as what their structure is. Identify different elements of each level, giving a synopsis of what its quest is, what is to be achieved in the level, how the player progresses through it, what they learn from it and what the ultimate end goal is.

### User Interface
Describe all elements that interface the game and the players. For example, how is the game controlled, how does it look (art style), how does it sound (audio and music), etc.
