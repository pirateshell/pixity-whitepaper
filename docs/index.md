##### Accesscity
The way they make their way around the city is by using Accesscity - a mobile app that leaverages AI technology combined with innovative navigation algorithms to make navigation in the city easy and accessible for all.

##### Pixity
However, users still need a reason to engage with the CU Ecosystem to begin with. This is where Pixity comes in - a separate solution that enhances Accesscity. Pixity combines board and digital game elements together with gamification design principles to provide an engaging way for people to create their journey through Gothenberg and motivate them to go out an explore using Accesscity to do so.

##### The full ecosystem

Once they are hooked, they can use Accesscity to actually navigate in an accessible way. This ultimately leads them to visiting real events, landmarks and social experiences in Gothenberg.
